PLEASE READ ALL THIS BEFORE OVERWRITING IT:

Thank you for reporting an issue with Elm! Before submitting, please make sure it's not a commonly reported issue or an issue that belongs elsewhere:

- If you're getting a runtime error, make sure you don't have any recursively defined values (see #873).
- If you're having trouble with type annotations in a let-expression, see #1214.
- If the issue relates to the core libraries (not the compiler) open an issue at https://github.com/elm-lang/core/issues
- If you found an unhelpful error message, report it at https://github.com/elm-lang/error-message-catalog/issues

Okay, now look through the "meta" issues to see if they cover your problem: https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-compiler/labels/meta

If you still don't see your bug or concern, delete this message and write up a report that satisfies the issue checklist!
