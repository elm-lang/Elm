BEFORE DELETING THIS:

- Is it a runtime error?          See https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-compiler/issues/1591
- Is it about type annotations?   See https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-compiler/issues/1214
- Is it about core libraries?     See https://github.com/elm-lang/core/issues
- Is it a bad error message?      See https://github.com/elm-lang/error-message-catalog/issues
- Does the compiler hang?         See https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-compiler/issues/1240
- Parser / code gen problem?      See https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-compiler/labels/meta

If none of that applies, write up a report that satisfies this checklist:
