Thank you for reporting an issue with Elm! Before submitting, please make sure it's not a commonly reported issue:

* If you're getting a runtime error, make sure you don't have any recursively defined values (see #873).
* If you're having trouble with type annotations in a let-expression, see #1214.
* If the issue relates to the core libraries and not the language, please open an issue in that repo [https://github.com/elm-lang/core/issues/new].
* If you've encountered an unhelpful error message, report it to the error message catalog [https://github.com/elm-lang/error-message-catalog/issues/new]
