module List where

{-| A library for manipulating lists of values. Every value in a
list must have the same type.

# Putting Lists Together
@docs concat, join, intersperse, zip, zipWith, repeat

# Taking Lists Apart
@docs partition, unzip

# Folds
@docs foldr, foldl

# Special Maps
@docs filterMap, concatMap, indexedMap

# Special Folds
@docs sum, product, maximum, minimum, all, any, foldr1, foldl1, scanl, scanl1

# Sorting
@docs sort, sortBy, sortWith

# Additional Zips
@docs zip3, zip4, zip5, zipWith3, zipWith4, zipWith5

If you can think of a legitimate use of `zipN` or `zipWithN` where `N` is 6 or
more, please let us know on [the
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/elm-discuss). The current
sentiment is that it is already quite error prone once you get to 4 and
possibly should be approached another way.
